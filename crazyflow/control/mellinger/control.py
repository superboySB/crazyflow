"""Mellinger controller reimplementation based on the Crazyflie firmware.

The controller is split into three pure functions that form a pipeline:
``state2attitude`` → ``attitude2force_torque`` → ``force_torque2rotor_vel``.
Each stage can be used independently or chained together to produce per-motor
RPM commands from a full-state setpoint. ``body_rate2force_torque`` replaces
the second stage for body rate setpoints.
