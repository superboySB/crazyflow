r"""Second-order fitted RPY dynamics (no rotor dynamics).

Rotational dynamics are modelled as a fitted second-order linear system driven by roll, pitch, and
yaw commands. Translational dynamics are driven by the collective thrust command directly, with no
motor spin-up lag. The command interface is ``[roll_rad, pitch_rad, yaw_rad, thrust_N]``.

\[
\begin{aligned}
    \dot{\mathbf{p}} &= \mathbf{v}, \\
    m\dot{\mathbf{v}} &= \mathbf{f}_\mathrm{g}
        + \mathbf{R}\,\mathbf{e}_\mathrm{z}
          (c_\mathrm{acc} + c_\mathrm{f} f_{\Sigma,\mathrm{cmd}}), \\
    \ddot{\boldsymbol{\Psi}} &=
        \boldsymbol{c}_{\boldsymbol{\Psi},1}\,\boldsymbol{\Psi}
        + \boldsymbol{c}_{\boldsymbol{\Psi},2}\,\dot{\boldsymbol{\Psi}}
        + \boldsymbol{c}_{\boldsymbol{\Psi},3}\,\boldsymbol{\Psi}_\mathrm{cmd},
\end{aligned}
\]

where \(\mathbf{f}_\mathrm{g} = m\mathbf{g}\).

!!! note
    This is the native Euler-angle form, matching
    [symbolic_dynamics_euler][crazyflow.dynamics.so_rpy.symbolic_dynamics_euler]. The simulation
    does not integrate this state directly. It shares the common ``[pos, quat, vel, ang_vel]`` state
    with the other models and advances the orientation from the body angular velocity
    \({}^{\mathcal{B}}\boldsymbol{\omega}\), converting \(\ddot{\boldsymbol{\Psi}} \leftrightarrow
    {}^{\mathcal{B}}\dot{\boldsymbol{\omega}}\) through the kinematic Jacobian at every step.
    Integrating from \({}^{\mathcal{B}}\boldsymbol{\omega}\) rather than \(\dot{\boldsymbol{\Psi}}\)
    makes the discrete trajectory differ slightly from integrating the Euler state directly. The
    difference, however, is negligible at our default frequency of 500 Hz.
