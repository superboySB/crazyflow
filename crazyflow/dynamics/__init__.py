"""Quadrotor dynamics for estimation, control, and simulation.

This package provides numeric and symbolic quadrotor dynamics at multiple fidelity levels. The
dynamics are implemented as pure functions compatible with any Array API backend (NumPy, JAX,
PyTorch, etc.) and with CasADi for symbolic computation.

The dynamics are at the core of Crazyflow's simulation. However, they are written to be as
self-contained as possible, so that they can be used independently for other purposes, such as state
estimation or control design.

Use [parametrize][crazyflow.dynamics.parametrize] to bind a dynamics function to a named drone
configuration, and ``available_dynamics`` to enumerate all registered dynamics.

    Feature flags are set by the [supports][crazyflow.dynamics.core.supports] decorator on each
    dynamics function and describe which optional inputs the dynamics accepts.

    Args:
        dynamics: A dynamics function, or a ``functools.partial`` wrapping one (as
            returned by [parametrize][crazyflow.dynamics.parametrize]).

    Returns:
        A dict of feature names to booleans. Currently contains:
            - ``"rotor_dynamics"``: ``True`` if the dynamics accepts and integrates
              ``rotor_vel``, ``False`` if passing ``rotor_vel`` raises a
              ``ValueError``.

    Example:
    ```python
    from crazyflow.dynamics import dynamics_features

    dynamics_features(dynamics)  # {'rotor_dynamics': True}
